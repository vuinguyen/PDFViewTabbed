/**
 WatermarkPage subclasses PDFPage so that it can override the draw(with box: to context:) method.
 This method is called by PDFDocument to draw the page into a PDFView. All custom drawing for a PDF
 page should be done through this mechanism.

 Custom drawing methods should always be thread-safe and call the super-class method. This is needed
 to draw the original PDFPage content. Custom drawing code can execute before or after this super-class
 call, though order matters! If your graphics run before the super-class call, they are drawn below the
 PDFPage content. Conversely, if your graphics run after the super-class call, they are drawn above the
 PDFPage.
